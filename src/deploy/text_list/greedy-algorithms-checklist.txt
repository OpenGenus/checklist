Only concepts that you need to review to master Greedy algorithms


Week 1: Greedy Algorithm Basics
===============================
1. Overview: Greedy Algorithm Basics
  In this week, you will learn about the fundamental concepts and techniques of greedy algorithms. The links
            cover a range of problems such as assigning cookies to children, filling a knapsack, finding the smallest
            missing positive integer, and dividing numbers into two groups. The links explore how a greedy approach can
            be used to solve each problem optimally by making locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of
            achieving a global optimal solution.

2. Introduction to Greedy
          Algorithms

3. Assign
          Cookies Problem
  Assign Cookies problem
            involves assigning cookies of different sizes to children with different greed levels such that the maximum
            number of children can be satisfied. The term "greed level" refers to the
            amount of cookies that each child desires. The greedy approach sorts the lists and iteratively checks for
            contentment by comparing the size of the cookie with the greedy level of the sibling. If the cookie size is
            greater than or equal to the greedy level, the sibling is considered contented, and the count is
            incremented.

4. Fractional Knapsack Problem
  Fractional
              Knapsack problem involves maximizing the total value of items that can be placed into a
            knapsack with a limited weight capacity. The naive approach involves
            trying all possible subsets of items and fractions to find the maximum profit. The greedy approach involves
            sorting the items in descending order of value/weight and then
            including them in the knapsack one-by-one until either the capacity is reached or there are no more items
            left. You can also dive deeper into different variations of the Knapsack Problem. The Unbounded
              Knapsack Problem involves maximizing the value of items that can be put into a
            knapsack of unlimited capacity, while the 0-1 Knapsack Problem involves choosing a subset of items to
            maximize value while staying within a knapsack's weight limit. The Bin Packing Problem
            involves packing items into bins of limited capacity while minimizing the number of bins used.

5. Remove
          K Digits to Make Smallest Number
  Remove K Digits to Make Smallest Number is the problem of
            removing K digits from a given number to make it the smallest possible number. The approach for this problem
            involves using the Monotonic Stack approach. A monotonic stack is a special type of stack that maintains a
            monotonic sequence of elements, either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing, as we move from the
            bottom to the top of the stack.

6. Smallest Missing Positive Integer
  Learn how to find the smallest missing positive integer  in an
            unsorted integer array in O(n) time and constant space complexity using a greedy approach with hashmaps. The
            brute force approach involves traversing the array multiple times and finding the next smallest integer each
            time. The sorting approach involves sorting the array and then finding the missing smallest positive
            integer by traversing from the start.

7. The
          smallest subset with sum greater than sum of all other elements
  Smallest Subset with Sum Greater than All Other Elements is
            the problem of finding the smallest subset of a given set of integers with a sum greater than the sum of all
            the other elements. The naive approach involves finding all possible subsets of the given set and then their
            sum is compared with the sum of the remaining elements. The greedy approach involves sorting the array in
            descending order and selecting the largest elements that sum up to at least half of the total sum of the
            given array. We select the largest elements to minimize the length of the subset.

8. Minimum
          number of Fibonacci terms with sum equal to a given number N
  Minimum Fibonacci Terms with Given Sum explains how to find the minimum number
            of Fibonacci terms that sum up to a given number using a greedy algorithm approach. The approach involves
            iterating through the Fibonacci sequence in reverse order and selecting the largest Fibonacci number that is
            less than or equal to the remaining sum, then subtracting that number from the sum and repeating the process
            until the sum becomes zero. Another similar problem is finding the number of ways to represent a
              given number as the sum of k Fibonacci numbers. This can be solved using either a brute force approach
            or a recursive approach.

9. Divide
          numbers from 1 to n into two groups with minimum sum difference from O(2^N) to O(N)
  Divide Numbers from 1 to N into Two Groups with Minimum Difference
            is the problem of dividing numbers from 1 to N into two groups such that the difference between the sum of
            the two groups is minimum. The naive approach involves generating all subsets of the array, calculating the
            sum of each subset, computing the absolute sum difference between the two subsets, and updating the minimum
            difference. The greedy approach involves sorting the numbers in descending order and assigning them to two
            groups with the goal of minimizing the difference between their sums.

Week 2: Maximum/Minimum Problems
================================
1. Overview: Maximum/Minimum Problems
  Learn about "Maximum/minimum problems", with a particular focus on greedy algorithms for solving
            problems related to finding the maximum or minimum values of a particular quantity. The links in this
            subcategory cover a range of problems, such as finding the largest and smallest numbers with a given number
            of digits and sum of digits, finding the largest cube formed by deleting minimum digits from a number, and
            maximizing the sum of the product of an array with its index subject to a given condition.

2. Largest Number with Given Number of Digits and Sum of Digits
  Largest Number with Given Number of Digits and Sum of Digits
            problem discusses an greedy algorithmic approach to finding the largest possible number with a specified
            number of digits and a given sum of those digits. It uses a while loop to add the digit 9 until the sum is
            greater than or equal to 9 and then adds the remaining sum as the last digit. The approach fills the
            remaining digits with 0s to obtain the largest possible number.

3. Smallest Number with Given Number of Digits and Digits Sum
  Smallest Number with Given Number of Digits and Digits Sum
            involves a greedy method for finding the smallest possible number with a specified number of digits and a
            given sum of those digits. It uses a loop to determine the value of each digit by subtracting the remaining
            sum from 9 until the remaining sum is less than 9, assigning the leftmost digit with the remaining sum.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/find-smallest-number-with-given-number-of-digits-and-digits-sum/
4. Largest Cube Formed by Deleting Minimum Digits from a Number
  Finding the Largest Cube Formed by Deleting Minimum Digits from a
              Number
            uses a greedy a technique to find the largest possible cube that can be formed by deleting a specified
            minimum number of digits from a given number. The brute force approach involves checking every subsequence
            of the
            number to see if it is a cube and comparing it with the maximum cube found so far. The greedy approach
            involves generating all perfect cubes from 1 to N, where N is the given number, and checking if the largest
            cube is a subsequence of the given number.

5. Maximize Sum of Array (i)
  Maximize Sum of
              Array (i) is a problem where we are given an array of integers and we maximize the sum of a function
            of array indices. The naive approach involves generating all permutations of the array, computing the sum of
            the product of array elements with their respective indices for each permutation, and returning the maximum
            value. The greedy approach involves sorting the array in increasing order, multiplying the minimum value of
            i with the minimum value of arr[i], and computing the sum of the product of array elements with their
            respective indices from i=0 to n-1.

Week 3: Scheduling Problems
===========================
1. Overview: Scheduling Problems
  In "Scheduling Problems", you will learn about greedy algorithms which involve optimizing the scheduling of
            tasks or events based on certain criteria. Examples include the Activity Selection Problem, Scheduling to
            Minimize Lateness, and Shortest Job First CPU Scheduling, each using a different objective and constraints.
  Links (0): 
2. Activity Selection Problem
  Activity Selection Problem involves selecting the maximum number of non-overlapping
            activities that can be performed in a single time slot, using a greedy algorithm approach. The approach
            sorts the activities in ascending order of their finish times and selects the first activity. It then
            selects the next activity that starts after the finish time of the previous activity, and repeats this
            process until no more activities can be selected.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/activity-selection-problem-greedy-algorithm/
3. Scheduling to Minimize Lateness
  Scheduling to Minimize Lateness involves scheduling a set of jobs with deadlines and
            processing times such that the maximum lateness is minimized. The approach sorts the requests in increasing
            order of their deadlines, calculates the start time for each request based on the previous requests'
            processing times, and computes the minimum lateness for the schedule. The approach outputs the minimum
            lateness for the schedule.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/scheduling-to-minimize-lateness/
4. Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling algorithm
  Learn about the Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU scheduling algorithm, which executes the
            process with the smallest required CPU time first. Throughput refers to the number of processes that are
            completed per unit of time, while turnaround time is the time taken to execute a process from the moment it
            enters the system until it completes execution. SJF algorithm aims to maximize the system's throughput and
            minimize the turnaround time by executing smaller processes first. The algorithm sorts a set of processes by
            their arrival and burst time. It then calculates the waiting time, completion time, and turn-around time for
            each process.

Week 3: Graph Based Problems
============================
1. Overview: Graph Based Problems
  Graph based problems involve solving problems related to graphs, such as finding the minimum spanning tree
            or the maximum clique. These problems can be tackled using a greedy approach that iteratively makes locally
            optimal decisions to ultimately arrive at a globally optimal solution. Examples include Graph Colouring,
            Single Maximal Clique, and Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm.
  Links (0): 
2. Graph
          Colouring - Greedy Algorithm
  Learn about graph coloring algorithms and understand the

            greedy
              algorithm for graph coloring. The greedy approach for this problem involves coloring the vertices of a
            graph one by one, using the smallest possible color that has not been used by any previously colored
            vertices that are adjacent to the current vertex. This approach is greedy because it chooses the smallest
            available color for each vertex, without considering the impact of that choice on the colors assigned to the
            remaining vertices. You can also learn about other algorithms and techniques used to solve a variety
            of graph problems. The Wigderson algorithm is a randomized algorithm used for graph coloring. The
            Welsh-Powell
              algorithm is a greedy algorithm used for graph coloring. The Bipartite
              Checking BFS algorithm is used to check whether a given graph is bipartite or not using Breadth-First
            Search (BFS).

3. Greedy
          Approach to Find Single Maximal Clique
  Greedy Approach to Find Single Maximal Clique involves finding the largest complete
            subgraph in a given graph. The approach involves starting with an arbitrary subgraph and growing it
            one vertex at a time by looping through the remaining vertices. For each vertex, it is added to the subgraph
            only if it is adjacent to every vertex that is already in the subgraph, and discarded otherwise. The process
            is repeated until there are no more vertices that can be added to the subgraph. For further exploration,
            consider learning about the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm, which is a method to find all maximal cliques in
            an undirected graph. Also learn about an algorithm that can be used to find only the cliques of a specific size k in the graph.

4. Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
  Learn about minimum spanning trees and their applications. Then understand the
            Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm used to find the
            minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted graph. It works by adding increasing cost edges that connect
            disconnected trees until a spanning tree is formed.

Week 3: Mathematical Algorithms
===============================
1. Overview: Mathematical Algorithms
  Learn about mathematical greedy algorithms which involve using a greedy approach to
            solve mathematical problems. Examples include the Egyptian Fraction Problem, Split Number into K parts with
            Maximum GCD, Make Elements Equal, and Maximum Perimeter of Triangle. In these problems, the greedy approach
            involves iteratively selecting the best possible option that satisfies certain mathematical constraints.
  Links (0): 
2. Egyptian Fraction Problem
  Egyptian
              Fraction Problem involves representing a positive fraction as a sum
            of unit fractions, i.e., fractions with a numerator of 1. The solution uses a greedy algorithm approach. The
            algorithm involves iteratively extracting the largest unit fraction and subtracting it until the remaining
            fraction becomes a unit fraction. The original fraction can then be represented as the sum of all extracted
            unit fractions.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/egyptian-fraction-problem/
3. Split
          Number into K Parts such that GCD is Maximum
  Split Number into K Parts such that GCD is Maximum problem involves splitting a
            given number into K parts such that their greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximum. The first approach
            calculates the minimum possible sum of K unique numbers and checks if the given number can be split into K
            unique numbers. It then finds the first number that can divide the given number and returns its quotient as
            the maximum GCD. The greedy approach uses the property of complementary numbers to find the divisors of the
            given number, checks if they have K elements, and returns the maximum GCD.

4. Minimum Number of Operations to make all the Array Elements Equal
  Learn how to find the
              minimum number of operations to make all elements of an array equal by finding the minimum element in
            the array as the target value, and then for each element in the array, calculate the amount of decrement
            operations required to reach the target value. The sum of all these operations gives the minimum number of
            operations required to make all elements of the array equal.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/make-elements-equal/
5. Maximum Perimeter of a Triangle
  Maximum
              Perimeter of a Triangle problem involves finding the maximum possible perimeter of a triangle,
            given an array of integers representing the lengths of line segments. In the greedy approach, the sides of
            the triangle are first sorted in increasing order, and then a loop starts from the last element. For each
            element, if the sum of the two previous elements is greater than the current element, the three sides are
            outputted as the result and the loop is broken. If no such triplet is found, the output is -1.

Week 4: Other Greedy Algorithm Problems
=======================================
1. Overview: Other Greedy Algorithm Problems
  Learn about other greedy problems that involve a common approach of iteratively making locally optimal
            decisions to arrive at a globally optimal solution. These problems include Fitting Shelves Problem, Huffman
            Encoding, Minimum Sum of Product of Two Arrays, Jump Game II, and many more.
  Links (0): 
2. Fitting Shelves Problem
  Fitting Shelves
              Problem involves fitting shelves of different lengths on a wall of fixed length, optimizing
            for minimum waste space. Given a wall of length W and two shelves of lengths m and n, the task is to find
            the minimum empty space on the wall after placing the maximum number of shelves on it. The brute force
            method involves trying every combination of the number of shelves, while the greedy algorithm tries to
            minimize the empty space by maximizing the use of larger shelves before using smaller ones.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/fitting-shelves-problem/
3. Huffman Encoding
  Huffman Encoding
            is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their
            frequency of occurrence in a message. Lossless compression is a type of data compression in which no
            information is lost during the compression process. The greedy approach of Huffman algorithm involves
            creating a min heap of leaf nodes with each character and its frequency, and repeatedly combining the two
            nodes with the smallest frequency into a new internal node with a sum of their frequencies, until only one
            node remains. The codes for each character are then printed by traversing the tree and appending a "0" or
            "1" to the code at each left or right turn, respectively. For a deeper dive into data compression
            algorithms, explore the Fano-Shannon algorithm.

4. Minimum Sum of Product of Two Arrays
  Minimum Sum of Product of Two Arrays
            problem uses a greedy approach to minimize the sum of the product of two arrays by sorting the arrays in
            ascending and descending orders. This allows for multiplying the smallest number of one array with the
            largest number of the other array. The approach involves multiplying each pair from both arrays and adding
            the results to get the sum. The brute force approach involves calculating all possible combinations of
            pairs, computing the sum of products for each combination, and choosing the one with the minimum sum.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/minimum-sum-of-product-of-two-arrays/
5. Jump Game II
  Jump Game II
            is the problem of finding the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the end of an array,
            where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be taken from that position. A few
            approaches discussed use the concepts of dynamic programming and finding the nth Fibonacci number.
            The first
            approach uses recursion to solve the problem by exploring all branches in a recursion tree and returning the
            minimum
            number of jumps to reach the last index. The second approach involves using dynamic programming to optimize
            the recursive solution by storing results of subproblems in an array to eliminate repeated work. The third
            approach is a
            top-down dynamic programming approach where solutions to smaller subproblems are found recursively and
            cached in an auxiliary array to be used for subsequent computations. The greedy approach makes an
            optimal choice at each step by determining the next steps that will push the index closer to the last index.

6. Smallest Palindrome Greater Than N With Same Digits
  Smallest Palindrome Greater Than N With Same Digits
            involves finding the smallest palindrome greater than a given number N using the same
            digits as N. The naive approach suggests generating all possible permutations of a number to find the next
            palindrome greater than N, but this can be computationally expensive if N is very large. The greedy approach
            involves checking if the given number N is already a palindrome, and if not, determining if a palindrome is
            possible by checking the frequency of characters. For odd-length strings, the character occurring an odd
            number of times is placed in the middle, and for even-length strings, the characters are placed
            symmetrically around the middle. The algorithm then returns the smallest possible palindrome greater than N.

7. Closest String with No Same Consecutive Character
  Closest String with No Same Consecutive Character
            is a problem of finding the closest string without any consecutive identical characters. The solution is
            a simple greedy approach that involves iterating through the input string, and if two consecutive
            characters are found to be the same, the current character is changed to its previous character.

8. Split
          N into Maximum Composite Numbers
  Split N into Maximum Composite Numbers
            problem employs an algorithm to split a given number N into a maximum number of composite numbers, by
            checking all possible
            splits and selecting the one with the maximum number of composite numbers. To maximize the number of
            composite numbers in a given number n, a greedy approach is used by dividing n by 4 and subtracting a
            certain number based on the remainder, either 9, 6, or 15, to make it perfectly divisible by 4.

9. Largest Lexicographic Array with at most K Consecutive Swaps
  Largest Lexicographic Array with at most K Consecutive Swaps
            challenge uses an algorithm to find the lexicographically largest permutation of an array with at most K
            consecutive swaps allowed. The naive approach involves generating all permutations. A better, greedy
            approach involves looping through the array and swapping each element with the largest
            element that can be swapped with it in at most K swaps until either K swaps have been made or the array is
            lexicographically largest.

10. Minimum Product Subset of an Array
  Minimum Product Subset of an Array
            problem utilizes an algorithm to find the minimum product subset of an array, i.e., the subset of elements
            whose product is minimum among all possible subsets. The naive approach generates all subsets of the array,
            whereas the greedy approach uses observations based on the number of negative numbers, zeros, and
            positive numbers in the array to determine the minimum product subset.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/minimum-product-subset-of-an-array/
11. Maximum Product Subset of an Array
  Learn how to find the maximum product subset of an array
            using a greedy algorithm to find the maximum product subset of an array, i.e., the subset of elements
            whose product is maximum among all possible subsets. The naive approach involves generating all subsets and
            calculating the product for each of them. The greedy approach is based on the number of negative numbers,
            zeros, and positive numbers in the array. Specifically, the approach considers four cases: odd number of
            negative numbers, even number of negative numbers, zeros and no positive numbers, and all numbers negative.

12. Largest Palindromic Number by Rearranging Digits
  Learn how to  find the largest palindromic number that can be formed by rearranging the
              digits of a given number N. The brute force approach involves finding all palindromic permutations of
            the digits, while the greedy approach counts the occurrences of each digit and rearranges them in a specific
            order to obtain the largest palindrome.
