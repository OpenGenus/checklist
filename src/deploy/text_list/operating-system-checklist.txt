2. Types of Operating Systems
  An operating system ( OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs .
        Operating Systems have evolved in past years. It went through several changes before getting its original form. These changes in the operating system are known as the evolution of operating systems

10. Scheduling & Spooling
  CPU Scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while another process is delayed (in standby) due to unavailability of any resources such as I / O etc, thus making full use of the CPU.
      Spooling is the process of temporary storage of data for use and execution by a device, program, or system. Data is sent to and stored in main memory or other volatile storage until it is requested for execution by a program or computer.

11. Operations & Buffering
  Input/output operations are the communications between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. 
     Buffering is a technique which is used to enhance the performance of I/O operations of the system. Basically, buffering in operating system is a method of storing data in a buffer or cache temporarily, this buffered data then can be accessed more quickly as compared to the original source of the data.

12. Interrupt Handling
  Interrupt handling refers to the process by which a computer system or program responds to an interrupt signal. An interrupt is a signal that indicates an event or condition that requires immediate attention from the processor. This can be triggered by hardware devices such as timers, I/O devices, or errors, as well as software-generated interrupts.

17. BIOS
  BIOS - firmware stored in non-volatile memory e.g EPROM, responsible for performing startup procedures such as POST before passing control to the bootloader which loads the OS.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/bios/
18. UEFI & Legacy
  UEFI & Legacy are firmware that specifies an interface between the computer operating system and the underlying firmware. Legacy boot involves booting the computer using legacy firmware such as BIOS and UEFI boot involves booting a computer using the more advanced UEFI.

19. Secure Boot
  Secure Boot is a security standard implemented in the advanced UEFI to prevent malware from attacking the computer during bootup when the computer is most vulnerable.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/secure-boot/
20. Threats & Vulnerabilities
  Threats and vulnerabilities in an operating system (OS) refer to potential risks or weaknesses that can be exploited by malicious actors or result in unintended consequences. These threats and vulnerabilities can compromise the security, stability, and functionality of the OS.
  Links (1): #
21. Security Policies & Enforcement
  Security policies and enforcements in an Operating System (OS) refer to the rules and mechanisms put in place to protect the system from unauthorized access, ensure data confidentiality and integrity, and mitigate potential security threats. These policies are typically enforced by the OS through various security mechanisms.
  Links (1): #
22. Encryption & Cryptography
  Encryption refers to the process of converting plain, readable data into an encoded or encrypted form. The purpose of encryption is to ensure that even if the data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized users, it remains unintelligible and can only be deciphered with the appropriate decryption key.
Cryptography involves techniques, protocols, and mathematical algorithms that secure communication, prevent unauthorized access, and protect confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. It includes encryption, decryption, digital signatures, key management, and various cryptographic protocols.
