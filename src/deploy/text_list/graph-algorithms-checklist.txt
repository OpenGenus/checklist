Week 2: Topological Sorting

  Topological
              Sort using BFS works by initially finding all the nodes in the graph with zero incoming edges and
            adding them to a queue. Then it repeatedly removes the first node from the queue, adds it to the
            topologically sorted list, and removes all of its outgoing edges. If any nodes have zero incoming edges as a
            result of this removal, they are added to the queue. This process continues until the queue is empty and all
            nodes have been added to the topologically sorted list.
