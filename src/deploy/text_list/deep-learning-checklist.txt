Deep Learning Checklist: 13 Months course

Deep Learning is not hard. With correct approach, order and intuition, you can master it easily.This checklist will guide you in the journey.


Week 1: Basics of DL
====================
1. Deep Learning
  Deep Learning has become quite a buzzword in recent years. It has taken over in all applications from tasks like image recognition, chatbots like Alexa and Google Assistant to defeating world champions in a complex games like Go and Dota 2.
                        So what exactly is deep learning and neural networks all about?

2. Relation to Data Science and ML
  Relation of Data Science to Deep Learning is fundamental. In data science and machine learning, engineers had to select the features related to a task but in Deep Learning, the features are identified and learnt automatically.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/relation-of-data-science
3. Linear Regression
  Linear Regression is a fundamental concept even high school students are aware of. This is the most basic Deep Learning model. It is just a straight line that divides a plane into two parts (think of two categories like pass or fail).
                        Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Linear Regression.
  Links (2): https://iq.opengenus.org/linear-regression/, https://iq.opengenus.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-linear-regression/
4. Line + Activation functions
  Simply adding multiple straight lines do not help create complex function as the result remains a straight line.
                        A straight line is limited so a simple operation known as activation function merge multiple straight lines to form a complex function. This introduces non-linearity and makes a strong DL model.

5. Perceptron (1st breakthrough)
  Perceptron is the first major breakthrough in DL.
Perceptron was invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt and sought to binary classify an input data. It was inspired by the ability of the central nervous system of the humans to be able to do the tasks that we do. The perceptron was one of the building blocks of modern artificial intelligence as we know it today.

6. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
  Multilayer perceptron is a fundamental concept in Machine Learning (ML) that lead to the first successful DL model, Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We have explored the idea of Multilayer Perceptron in depth.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/multilayer-perceptron/
7. Neural Network (NN)
  Neural Network act as a ‘black box’ that takes inputs and predicts an output.
                        It’s different and ‘better’ than most traditional Machine Learning algorithms because it learns complex non-linear mappings to produce far more accurate output classification results.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/understand-neural-networks-intuitively/
8. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  Artificial Neural Network is a form of computing system that vaguely resembles the biological nervous system. It is composed of very many neurons that are centres of computation and learn by a sort of hit and trial method over the course of many epochs.
  Links (2): https://iq.opengenus.org/artificial-neural-networks/, https://iq.opengenus.org/artificial-neural-networks/
9. Deep Learning Frameworks
  No knowledge is useful if you cannot use it practically. Deep Learning is a complex subject if you need to work on minute details. The developer community is strong so several software utilities/ frameworks have been developed which aid one to implement DL ideas quickly.
 Deep Learning Frameworks are crucial for developing models and we will explore the different kinds of frameworks in this article and you will find
                        the ones that suit you the most. TensorFlow is one of the best choice of DL framework.

10. Training and Inference
  Given a DL model like ANN, it require specific values like weights. These are crucial for solving a task using DL efficiently. These values can be identified using training process.
                        Once a DL model is training, it can be run on any input to solve a task. This execution is known as Inference.

Week 2: Basic operations (ops)
==============================
1. Different Layers / operations (ops)
  A DL model is made up of different layers. Understanding the significance or purpose or importance of each Layer in a DL model is important.
                        Different layers include convolution, pooling, normalization and much more. 
                        For example: the significance of MaxPool is that it decreases sensitivity to the location of features.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/purpose-of-different-layers-in-ml
2. Dot Product and Matrix Multiplication
  Dot Product are used in neural networks to tweak the different weights. It is used for calculating the simularities between vectors, computing the ouput of a convolutional layer, and training neural networks.
                        Matrix Multiplication is another core mathematical operation that is used within Convolution operation (the most used fundamental operation in DL).

4. Hidden Layer
  The input layer contains input neurons that send information to the hidden layer  
                        The hidden layer sends data to the output layer.
                        Every neuron has weighted inputs, an activation function, and one output.
                        The input layer takes inputs and passes on its scores to the next hidden layer for 
                        further activation and this goes on till the output is reached. 
                        Synapses are the adjustable parameters that convert a neural network 
                        to a parameterized system.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/hidden-layers/
5. Bias op
  Bias 
                        is an constant parameter in the Neural Network which is used in adjusting the output. Therefore, Bias is a additional parameter which helps the model so that it can perfectly fit for the given data.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/bias-machine-learning/
6. Convolution ops
  Convolution is the most fundamental operations in DL models that focus on extracting visual information. This is a variant of Matrix Dot Product and enables to highlight different features in a data. Convolution has a filter data that DL models have to learn based on the task in hand.
                        In CNN models, 70% of time is spent in these category of ops.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/convolution-layer/

  Flatten and Squeeze 
                        are two important operations used in the manipulation of tensors in Deep Learning. These operations come into play when we want to reshape tensors. Reshaping operations are extremely important because the layers in a neural network only accept dimensional specific inputs.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/flatten-and-squeeze-tensors/
9. Padding ops
  All operations tend to decrease the size of the data. Sometimes, we need to increase data size.  Padding ops are used to increase the size of the intermediate data by adding default values across the edges.

  Indirect Convolution Algorithm 
                        is as efficient as the GEMM primitive without the overhead of im2col transformations - instead of reshuffling the data, an indirection buffer is introduced (a buffer of pointers to the start of each row of image pixels). It can similarly support arbitrary Convolution parameters and leverage previous research on high-performance GEMM implementation.
 Separable Convolution 
                        The spatial separable convolution works on the spatial features of an image: its width and its height. These features are the spatial dimensions of the image hence the name, spatial separable.
 Kn2row 
                        is based on the fact that a KxK convolution may be computed by first shifting and combining the partial outputs from K.K 1x1 convolutions. MxHxW is the additional buffer space necessary for this.
