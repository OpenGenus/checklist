                 experienced a data breach that exposed the personal information of around 57 million users and 
                 600,000 drivers. The breach was not immediately disclosed to the affected individuals or regulatory 
                 authorities, which led to significant controversy.

15. Choking algorithm in BitTorrent
  BitTorrent 
                   is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol that facilitates the distribution of large files across the 
                   internet. Unlike traditional client-server models, where a central server serves files to multiple clients, 
                   BitTorrent employs a decentralized approach where users collectively share and distribute files.

Section 6: Design Principles and Patterns
=========================================
1. Liskov substitution principle
  The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) 
                    is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming that emphasizes the relationship between a base class and its derived classes.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/liskov-substitution-principle/
2. Open-closed principle
  The Open-Closed Principle (OCP), 
                   is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming design. It states that software entities (such as classes, 
                   modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/open-closed-principle/
3. Dependency inversion principle
  The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
                   is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and design. It suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level 
                   modules, but both should depend on abstractions.

4. Cache stampede
  Cache stampede, 
                also known as "dog-piling" or "thundering herd," is a phenomenon that occurs in caching

Section 9: Containerization and Orchestration
=============================================
1. Infrastructure as a service
  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  
                    is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/infrastructure-as-a-service/
2. Idea of virtualization
  Virtualization  
                   is a fundamental concept in system design that involves creating virtual instances of computing 
                   resources, such as servers, storage, and networks, to effectively utilize physical hardware. By 
                   abstracting physical resources, virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) or virtual 
                   environments to run on a single physical machine, enhancing resource utilization, flexibility, and cost-efficiency.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/virtualization/
3. Application layer with Microservices and Service Discovery

                   is a technology that enables the packaging and isolation of applications and their dependencies into a 
                   standardized unit called a "container." Containers provide a consistent and reproducible environment for 
                   applications to run across different computing environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Section 10: Temp (Confusion)
============================
1. RPC vs. REST
  The choice between 
                    RPC and REST
                   depends on the project's requirements. If you need efficient communication between services
                    with strict performance needs, RPC might be a good fit. On the other hand, if you want a 
                    more standardized, scalable, and flexible approach to building APIs, REST is often a 
                    preferred choice due to its compatibility with HTTP and its ability to handle various client types.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/rpc-vs-rest/
2. Context switching in OS
  Context switching, 
                   is a fundamental concept in operating systems that enables multitasking, where multiple processes or threads 
                   share a single CPU core. It refers to the process of saving and restoring the state of a process or thread 
                   so that the CPU can seamlessly switch from one task to another.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/context-switching-in-os/
3. Fault Tolerance in System Design
  Fault tolerance 
                     in system design refers to the system's ability to continue functioning, albeit with reduced performance, even when 
                     certain components or parts of the system fail.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/fault-tolerance-in-system-design/
4. The lock convoy problem in OS
  The"lock convoy problem"
                    in operating systems refers to a performance issue that arises in multi-threaded applications when multiple threads 
                    compete for a single resource, such as a shared lock, in a synchronized manner. This competition can lead to inefficient 
                    resource utilization and reduced overall system performance.
