Python fluency Checklist with Practical Projects

Only topics that you need to practice to get to an advanced level in Python.Nothing more,
        Nothing less.


Variables
=========
1. Introduction to Variables
  There are several types of variables like Scalar variables which contains Integer, float and many
                        other variable sub types.
                        Variables help us to store information which we can then use in a program.

Control Flow
============
1. If-else statements
  If-else
                            statements help us to check whether certain
                        conditions are met or not. Code inside the if statement only runs when the
                        if condition is true.
                        Otherwise, the code inside the else condition runs.

2. While loops
  While loops
                        run
                        the code inside them repeatedly as long as the while condition evaluates to true. When the
                        condition evaluates to false, the code inside the while loop stops running.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/while-loop-python/
3. For Loops
  When we want to run our code for a specific number of times, we use for
                            loops. We can also use these loops for many other purposes.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/for-loop-python/
4. is and is not operators in Python
  The is
                            and is not operators help in comparing values and objects in our programs.

Functions
=========
1. Introduction to Functions
  Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, we can create
                        
                            functions and use them whenever we need to throughout the program. This
                        saves time in writing code. Functions also sometimes require the use of
                        arguments which we need to pass into the function.
  Links (2): https://iq.opengenus.org/functions-in-python/, https://iq.opengenus.org/python-function-arguments/
2. Variable and Function Scope
  Whether we can access a variable throughout the program depends on its
                            scope. This has important implications whenever we create any program. The
                        same logic applies when we create any function.
                        One of the most commonly used functions is the 
                            range  function. The i
                        variable in this function is always local-scoped.
  Links (3): https://iq.opengenus.org/python-variable-scope/, https://iq.opengenus.org/function-scope-in-python/, https://iq.opengenus.org/range-function-python/
3. Lambda Functions
  Generally, we have to name our functions to use them. But we can also create nameless functions,
                        also known as anonymous functions. In Python, we call them
                            Lambda
                            functions. We can also use these to shorten statements like if-else.
  Links (2): https://iq.opengenus.org/lambda-function-python/, https://iq.opengenus.org/python-lambda-if-else/

---

Modules
=======
1. What are modules?
  For any task like data analysis, machine learning, image or audio
                        processing etc, specifically created and grouped utilities and functions exist, which we call as
                        libraries. In Python, we call them modules. Many Python modules exist for a variety of
                        purposes. An example of a module is the Random module, which
                        generates random values in our programs.
  Links (2): https://iq.opengenus.org/module-in-python/, https://iq.opengenus.org/python-random-module/

---

Classes
=======
1. Introduction to Classes and Objects
  Classes
                        are like templates for creating objects in Python. What are objects? Every element in Python is
                        an object. Every object is an instance of some class. The concept of
                        class variable
                        discusses this in brief.
  Links (2): https://iq.opengenus.org/classes-in-python/, https://iq.opengenus.org/static-class-variable-in-python/
2. Abstraction
  Abstraction helps us to represent objects in our programs with the required essential features
                        and without unnecessary details. Abstract classes
                         help us use abstraction in our programs.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/abstract-base-class-in-python/
3. Decorators
  We can alter how classes or functions work in our programs using Decorators in Python.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/decorators-in-python/
4. Descriptors
  As classes may have different class attributes, Descriptors help to create, control and manage such attributes.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/descriptors-in-python/

---

Data Structures
===============
1. Lists
  Data structures like lists store objects of different data types together in
                        one place. We can also access and change items inside lists using indexing.
  Links (2): https://iq.opengenus.org/lists-in-python/, https://iq.opengenus.org/negative-index-in-python/
2. Arrays
  Arrays
                        store objects of the same data type, which we can access later on in our programs.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/array-in-python/
3. Tuples
  We can store multiple objects inside Tuples. Once we put items inside a tuple,
                        we cannot change them.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/tuple-python/
4. Dictionaries
  We can store information in key-value pairs using dictionaries. Like lists, we can also access and change items inside
                        them.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/dictionary-python/
5. Set
  Sets help
                        us store information like lists, the difference being that we
                        cannot put duplicate values inside them. Also, sets will automatically
                        sort the data we put inside them.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/set-in-python/
6. Deque
  Double Ended Queue, also known as  Deque, helps us store information which we can then
                        modify from both sides of the queue, from the start or end.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/deque-python/
7. Mutable and Immutable Objects
  When we can modify objects, we call them mutable. Otherwise, we call them immutable. We have to
                        design our programs carefully with a proper knowledge of mutable and immutable objects.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/mutable-and-immutable-in-python/

Regular Expressions
===================
1. Introduction to Regular Expressions
  Regular
                            expressions help us to match or search for a particular pattern
                        in data. We can also use these to shorten our code.
  Links (1): https://iq.opengenus.org/regex-python/

---

Unit Testing
============
1. Introduction to Unit Testing
  For bug-free code, test driven development is of vital importance. Unit Testing helps us to test individual components in our program and
                        ensure that it's error-free.
