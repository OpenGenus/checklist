3. **Count inversions in array**<br>  This is another HOT interview problem in advanced rounds: [Count inversions in an array](https://iq.opengenus.org/count-inversions-in-an-array-using-fenwick-tree/). This is solved using the idea of [Fenwick Tree](https://iq.opengenus.org/fenwick-tree-range-product/).
4. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**<br>  The problem of Longest Increasing Subsequence is a standard problem that is solved using [Binary Search and Dynamic Programming](https://iq.opengenus.org/longest-increasing-subsequence/). The challenge is to use [Fenwick Tree to solve LIS problem](https://iq.opengenus.org/longest-increasing-subsequence-fenwick-tree/). 2 follow-up questions are to find [Longest Common Increasing Subsequence](https://iq.opengenus.org/longest-common-increasing-subsequence/) and [Longest Increasing Consecutive Subsequence](https://iq.opengenus.org/longest-increasing-consecutive-subsequence/).
