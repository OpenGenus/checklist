1. **Evolution of Operating systems**<br>  
2. **Types of Operating Systems**<br>  An operating system ( OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs .
        Operating Systems have evolved in past years. It went through several changes before getting its original form. These changes in the operating system are known as the [evolution of operating systems](#)
3. **Distributed Operating System**<br>  A [distributed operating system](https://iq.opengenus.org/distributed-operating-system/) is a concept in which distributed programs operate on several machines that are linked together via communications. But it has its 
      [challenges ](https://iq.opengenus.org/challenges-failures-in-distributed-systems/) too.
4. **GNU/Linux**<br>  Linux or [GNU/Linux](https://iq.opengenus.org/gnu-linux/) is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project.
