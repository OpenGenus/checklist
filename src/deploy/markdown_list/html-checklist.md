Welcome to the world of HTML, the backbone of the web! and these are the concepts that you need to practice to master HTML(HyperText Markup Language).

**Week 1: Getting Started**
=======================
1. **Introduction**<br>  [HyperText Markup Language (HTML)](https://iq.opengenus.org/html-tags-list/) is the language that powers the structure of every webpage you encounter.
          It's like the blueprint that defines how content is presented on the internet.
2. **XML**<br>  [XML](https://iq.opengenus.org/xml/) stands for Extensible Markup Language. It was developed to encode data and information in a format that could be easily interpreted by humans and computers alike.
3. **SHTML**<br>  [SHTML](https://iq.opengenus.org/shtml/) [SHTML](https://iq.opengenus.org/shtml/) is a file extension (.shtml) that denotes that the current file is an HTML document (.html) with an extra feature known as Server Side Includes. This was a widely used feature in early 2010s.
4. **HTML**<br>  [HTML](https://iq.opengenus.org/html-tag-in-html/) and [CSS](https://iq.opengenus.org/basics-of-css/) are essential for web development and a good understanding of the [key terms](https://iq.opengenus.org/key-terms-in-html-and-css/) used is necessary.
5. **Types of HTML**<br>  There are 4 different types of HTML file extensions and the extension denote a specific feature enabled in the HTML web page [Types of HTML](https://iq.opengenus.org/types-of-html-file/).

3. **Div**<br>  The [Div](https://iq.opengenus.org/ways-to-center-elements-in-html/) element is used as a container for other HTML elements.
4. **Button Tag**<br>  [Button Tag](https://iq.opengenus.org/button-tag/) Buttons are like the ears of the websites we create.When they are clicked, they listen to our options or choices and subsequently required actions take place.
5. **Span Tag**<br>  [Span Tag](https://iq.opengenus.org/html-span-tag/) span is similar to all the other HTML elements, it starts with an opening tag span and ends with an closing tag span.
6. **Footer Tag**<br>  [Footer Tag](https://iq.opengenus.org/noscript-tag/) In HTML, the footer element is used to define a footer for a section or a page. The footer typically contains metadata, copyright information, links to related documents, authorship details, or any other information that is relevant to the content enclosed by the surrounding section or the entire page.

10. **Video Tag**<br>  [Video Tag](https://iq.opengenus.org/html5-video-with-fallback/) embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. We can use video tag for audio content as well, but the audio tag may provide a more appropriate user experience..
11. **No Script Tag**<br>  [Noscript Tag](https://iq.opengenus.org/noscript-tag/) can be refer to a situation where JavaScript code is implemented or executed without using the script tag.

**Week 3: Advanced HTML Tags**
==========================
1. **Heading**<br>  [Heading](https://iq.opengenus.org/headings-in-html/) element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading.
2. **HTML Lists**<br>  [Lists](https://iq.opengenus.org/lists-in-html/) [Lists](https://iq.opengenus.org/lists-in-html/) are used commonly to create a set of data/information having common features using bullets/numbers.
3. **HTML Tables**<br>  [HTML Tables](https://iq.opengenus.org/tables-in-html/) HTML tables allow  developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
4. **Datalist**<br>  [Datalist](https://iq.opengenus.org/del-tag-in-html/) In HTML, the datalist element is used to provide a set of predefined options for other form-related elements, such as input and textarea.

7. **# in href**<br>  [# in href](https://iq.opengenus.org/javascript-void-href-in-html-links/) is used to indicate that the link does not have a destination URL and that its behavior is defined by JavaScript code. When a user clicks on a link with javascript:void(0) in the href attribute, nothing happens by default. However, you can use JavaScript to define an action for the link, such as displaying a popup or executing a function.
8. **Superscript**<br>  The [Superscript](https://iq.opengenus.org/superscript-in-html/) is a text that appear above the preceding text which means it lies on half a character above the normal base line and the font is smaller.

Today, Computers have different fonts due to the contribution of Steve Jobs which gave Apple its first advantage over competitors like Microsoft. When building a web page in HTML, we need to consider various factors such as screen size to provide the best fonts in the perfect format.
6. **Radio Button**<br>  [Radio Buttons](https://iq.opengenus.org/radio-buttons-in-html/) are clickable circles that are a type of an input element in HTML.
