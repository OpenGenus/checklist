# System Design Checklist

System design is the process of creating the architecture, modules, components, interfaces, and data for a system. 
    System design is the core concept behind the design of any distributed systems. These concepts are now repeatedly being asked in several interviews. 
    This checklist covers all the important concepts with which you can ace your interviews!

**Section 0: Different Components of System Design**
================================================
1. **Software development lifecycles**<br>  Software Development Lifecycles (SDLC)

                    with strict performance needs, RPC might be a good fit. On the other hand, if you want a 
                    more standardized, scalable, and flexible approach to building APIs, REST is often a 
                    preferred choice due to its compatibility with HTTP and its ability to handle various client types.
2. **Context switching in OS**<br>  [Context switching](https://iq.opengenus.org/context-switching-in-os/), 
                   is a fundamental concept in operating systems that enables multitasking, where multiple processes or threads

                   so that the CPU can seamlessly switch from one task to another.
3. **Fault Tolerance in System Design**<br>  [Fault tolerance](https://iq.opengenus.org/fault-tolerance-in-system-design/) 
                     in system design refers to the system's ability to continue functioning, albeit with reduced performance, even when 
                     certain components or parts of the system fail.
4. **The lock convoy problem in OS**<br>  The["lock convoy problem"](https://iq.opengenus.org/lock-convoy-problem/)
                    in operating systems refers to a performance issue that arises in multi-threaded applications when multiple threads 
                    compete for a single resource, such as a shared lock, in a synchronized manner. This competition can lead to inefficient 
                    resource utilization and reduced overall system performance.
